## Advent of Code 2022

This year my goal is to increase my familiarity with Rust.

To verify a particular day's solution, just run `cargo test --tests day_XX`

To run a benchmark test for a particular day, run `cargo bench --benches day_XX` (This requires a nightly Rust toolchain)

For my reference, below is a list of tools that I used for the first time in this year's Advent of Code.

### cargo bench
### once_cell
### rayon
